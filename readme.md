## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- Right now I the connect and redirect using Render gives a bad login, which prevents the data from being grabbed. I plan to continue to work on this to make it possible for the app to function as intended
- Improve the user interface and user experience of the app
- Like with my other spotify project, I want to add more analytics and visualizations to give users deeper insights into their listening habits
